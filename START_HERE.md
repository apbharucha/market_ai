# Kill any running Streamlit
pkill -9 -f "streamlit run"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still don't see changes:

1. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

2. **Check browser cache**:
   - Open developer tools (F12)
   - Right-click reload button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Verify only one Streamlit is running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep streamlit | grep -v grep
   ```
   Should show only ONE process.

4. **If multiple processes**, kill all:
   ```bash
   pkill -9 -f "streamlit run"
   ```
   Then restart using the script above.
